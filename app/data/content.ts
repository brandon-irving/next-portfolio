      "My journey in technology is driven by a passion for building impactful solutions. At Altruist, I led teams to develop the patented Fault Tolerant Multi-Account Opening feature, enhancing scalability with React, TypeScript, and Node.js.

The Fandom Charades Game. Built with Expo, TypeScript, and Tamagui, it earned a 4.9-star rating for its engaging user experience. Technology is more than my professionâ€”it's my joy. I'm dedicated to delivering innovative solutions that drive impact and delight users",
